Mu is a simple code editor for beginner programmers based on the feedback given
to and experiences of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's education team. Having said
that, Mu is for anyone who wants to use a simple "no frills" editor.

It's written in Python and works on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.

We have `extensive developer documentation <https://mu.readthedocs.io/>`_
