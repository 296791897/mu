What were you doing?
--------------------

Please list the steps we need to follow to recreate the issue you're reporting.

* I was using Mu version ???? on <insert operating system here>.
* step 2
* step 3

What did you expect to happen?
------------------------------

Give a brief description of how you expected Mu to behave given what you were doing, as described above.

What actually happened?
-----------------------

Give a description of how Mu actually behaved. Please include screenshots if this is appropriate.

Why is this problematic?
------------------------

Given the difference in the expected and actual behaviour, please describe why this is a problem.

Sometimes Mu behaves in a way that surprises people. We like to hear why such behaviour is surprising. However,
sometimes such surprising behaviour is a feature. Obviously, if Mu crashes or doesn't fulfil a fundamental task
(for example, it fails to save a file correctly) then we need to know as much about the context of your
environment as possible.

Attach Logs!
------------

Please remember to attach a copy of the log files for Mu. You can get the logs by clicking on the cog
icon in the bottom right of the editor window. Click on the logs and use CTRL-A to select all, then 
CTRL-C to copy and CTRL-V to paste the contents into the issue.
