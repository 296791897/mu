Mu: A Python Code Editor
========================

.. note::

    **This documentation is NOT for users of Mu**. Rather, it is for software
    developers who want to improve Mu. 

    For tutorials, how-to guides and user related discussion, please see the
    project's website for users of Mu at: https://codewith.mu/

What?
-----

Mu is a very simple Python editor for kids, teachers and beginner programmers.
It's written in Python and works on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.

    "[Papert] realized, 'Oh, we could take the real content out here as a
    version in the child's world that is still the real thing.' It's not a fake
    version of math. It's kind of like little league, or even T-ball. In sports
    they do this all the time. In music, they do it all the time. The idea is,
    you never let the child do something that isn't the real thing -- but you
    have to work your ass off to figure out what the real thing is in the
    context of the way their minds are working at that developmental level."
    -- `Alan Kay <https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now>`_

Mu aspires to be "the real thing" as a development environment for beginner
programmers taking their first steps with Python.

As a rule of thumb, if you're able to ask "why doesn't Mu have [feature X]?"
then you're probably too advanced for using Mu as a development environment. In
which case, you should graduate to a more advanced editor.

Why?
----

There isn't a cross platform Python code editor that is:

* Easy to use;
* Available on all major platforms;
* Well documented (even for beginners);
* Simply coded;
* Currently maintained; and,
* Thoroughly tested.

Mu addresses these needs.

How?
----

Mu's outlook is:

* Less is more (remove all unnecessary distractions);
* Keep it simple (so Mu is easy to understand);
* Walk the path of least resistance (Mu should be easy to use);
* Have fun (learning should be a positive experience).

Mu's own code is simple, clearly organised and well tested. It's copiously
commented and mostly found in a few obviously named Python files.

This has been done on purpose: we want teachers and kids to take ownership of
this project and organising the code in this way aids the first steps required
to get involved.

If you're looking for ways to get involved check out some of the
:doc:`first-steps` for new contributors.

Furthermore, we put our users at the centre of our development work. Extensive
interviews with teachers, observations of lessons and exceptionally clear and
helpful feedback from the education team at the
`Raspberry Pi Foundation <https://www.raspberrypi.org/education/>`_
(perhaps the most successful computing in education project in history) have
informed the design choices for Mu.

Who?
----

**You!**

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. If you're thinking, "but they don't
mean me", *then we especially mean YOU*. Good quality code and engagement
with respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky
  groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most geeky
  groups, get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - *your
  fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, just people. Get involved!
* We are interested in educational, social and technical problems. If you are
  too, get involved.
* This is a new community. *No-one knows what they are doing*, so, get
  involved.

We want the Mu community to be a friendly place. Therefore, we expect
contributors to follow the Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct:
